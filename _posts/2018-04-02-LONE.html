<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/2.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Making "edible flowers". Ingredients: flour, water, various colouring ingredients - here: curcuma, paprika powder, cherry juice, elderberry juice, hazelnut puree - and some carrot and dried mushrooms. If you prefer keeping your sanity, use actual food colouring and don't add carrots or dried mushrooms.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/3.png%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Add the respective ingredients and water (if necessary) to a small pile of flour, knead thoroughly, let the doughs rest for a while (in plastic wrap, so it doesn't dry out), and roll it. Shown here: yellow curcuma/paprika powder dough with carrots, pink cherry dough, purple elderberry dough, put-everything-together-and-hope-for-orange dough (that is less orange than the yellow dough), brown hazelnut dough with mushrooms.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/4.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Make different kinds of dough flowers and mushrooms and let them dry for a while.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/5.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Making a mushroom risotto. Ingredients: Rice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, vegetable broth, lemon, onion, garlic, mushrooms, cheese. Juice the lemon, slice the onion, mince the garlic, dice the mushrooms and cheese, prepare some broth, remember I'm an adult now and can use mom's wine.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/6.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Heat olive oil and add onions and garlic. When the onion is soft, add the rice, the wine, the lemon juice, and some balsamic vinegar. When the fluids are nearly gone, add some broth and the mushrooms. Let it simmer and add broth every time there is only little broth left. Stir often, be patient, keep the pan open. When the rice is cooked, add cheese and some butter and mix it in.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/8.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Making the actual salad. Ingredients: lettuce (romaine + iceberg), lentils (from a can), sunflower seeds, mushrooms, edible flowers. Roast the sunflower seeds, slice and fry the mushrooms, carefully boil the flowers in salted water</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/9.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Put the lettuce in a baking dish, add lentils, mushrooms and sunflower seeds.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/LONE/10.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Add the flowers and some decorative tomatoes. Serve with a simple vinaigrette.<br><br>(technically also add the risotto, but the risotto was my dinner and the salad my breakfast the day after so I didn't want to mix them - both were very tasty!)</p></div>
